## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 4 committed (officially 5 stories but one is duplicated), 4 done
- Total points committed vs done: 10 committed, 10 done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 31h 30m planned, 33h 05m spent


### Definition of Done (DoD)
 
- API testing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? <br/>
  Overall the estimation seems good, but focusing on particular tasks the estimation was different from reality as some tasks were highly overestimated while others underestimated.
  One error in estimation was caused by little knowledge about other team members and their capabilities. One of the main causes of misestimated time is the fact that we have been too much optimistic about the programming tasks and we didn't take into accout possible coding issues.
  Another error was on the great focus given to side activities that come after the development phase as merging, testing and setting up the environment.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? <br/>
  Don't underrate development tasks as some functionalities can appear easy to describe but difficult to code.
  Put more focus on the development part as tiny issues can be time consuming if they are not immediately recognised.
  Invest more time on adopting an unified code design as the code can then be easily understood by each team member.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?  <br/>
  This is our first sprint and we don't have another retrospective to compare with.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? <br/>
  This is our first sprint and we don't have another retrospective to compare with.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.) <br/>
  Improve team coordination in the development so various parts can be merged as soon as possible as the merging process needs time and leads to changes to each part so that they can interact. This can be achieved by analyzing the code developed by other team members.
  Reduce the number of coding issues related to knowledge of the language (React in our case) and this can be done scheduling meetings more often to discuss how to develop things and use knowledge of other team members to solve problems.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!! <br/>
  A lot of trust towards the other team members, although none of us knew the development skills of others, and this led to a great team work with a balanced workload and a good result.
